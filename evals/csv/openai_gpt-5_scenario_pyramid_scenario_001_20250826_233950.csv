## **PYRAMID PUZZLE - GAME RULES**

### **Objective**

Reach the peak of the pyramid (tile A1) after collecting the Key, using the minimum number of Movement Points (MP).

---

### **PYRAMID STRUCTURE & LAYOUT**

The pyramid is a five-level, four-sided structure. For gameplay, it's best to visualize it from a **top-down perspective**, like a series of concentric squares.

| Level | Symbol | Total Tiles | Tiles per Side | Tile Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Peak | A | 1 (Center) | - | A1 |
| 4th | B | 4 | 1 | B1 to B4 |
| 3rd | C | 8 | 2 | C1 to C8 |
| 2nd | D | 16 | 4 | D1 to D16 |
| Base | E | 32 | 8 | E1 to E32 |

**Tile Numbering**:

Tiles are numbered **counter-clockwise** around each square level.

- **E1** is the bottom-left corner of the entire pyramid base.
- The numbering continues up the left side, across the top, down the right side, and across the bottom back to the start.
- **Corner Tiles on Level E**: E1, E9, E17, E25.

---

### **MOVEMENT SYSTEM**

From most tiles, you can move in up to 5 directions. Think of movement as either moving *around* a level, moving *inward* to a higher level, or *outward* to a lower level.

### **Notation**

XY - represents the single tile on the pyramid:
- X: represents the level on the pyramid, for example B
- Y: represents number of the the tile on the level X, for example 8
- Xmax: max value of Y for the level X:
    A - 1
    B - 4
    C - 8
    D - 16
    E - 32

### **1. AROUND**

This is like walking along the edge of one of the pyramid's square layers.

**COUNTER-CLOCKWISE**

- **From**: XY
- **To**: X(Y-1), or X(Xmax) if Y=1 (this is just turning a corner).
- *Example*: C3 → C2. From corner C1, the next tile counter-clockwise is C8.

**CLOCKWISE**

- **From**: XY
- **To**: X(Y+1), or X1 if Y=Xmax (this is just turning a corner).
- *Example*: C7 → C8. From corner C8, the next tile clockwise is C1.

### **2. INWARD (Up a Level)**

You move from your current tile to the single tile on the level above that rests over it. Each upper tile connects to two adjacent lower tiles.

- **From**: XY
- **To**: (X+1)⌈Y/2⌉
- *Example*: Both **E5** and **E6** are ""underneath"" **D3**. Moving Inward from either E5 or E6 takes you to D3.

### **3. OUTWARD (Down a Level)**

You move from your current tile to one of the two tiles directly beneath it on the level below.

**OUTWARD-LEFT**

- **From**: XY
- **To**: (X-1)(2Y-1)
- *Example*: From C3, you can move Outward-Left to **D5**.

**OUTWARD-RIGHT**

- **From**: XY
- **To**: (X-1)(2Y)
- *Example*: From C3, you can move Outward-Right to **D6**.

### **Special Cases**

- **Starting Position**: Players can start from any E-level tile (E1 through E32).
- **From the Peak (A1)**: Can only move OUTWARD to any B tile (B1, B2, B3, or B4).
- **To the Peak (A1)**: All B tiles can move INWARD to A1.
- **From the Base (E-Tiles)**: Cannot move OUTWARD.

---

### **MOVEMENT COSTS**

| Movement Direction | Base Cost | With Ladder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clockwise / Counter-Clockwise | 1 MP | 1 MP |
| Outward-Left / Outward-Right | 1 MP | 1 MP |
| **Inward (Up a Level)** | **2 MP** | **1 MP** |

---

### **SPECIAL TILES**

| Tile Type | Effect | Cost to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Blocked** | Cannot enter this tile. | - |
| **Key** | Required to enter A1 and win the game. | 0 MP to collect |
| **Dynamite** | Clears any blocked tile permanently on the pyramid (single use). Basically means you can enter ONE blocked tile after colecting the dynamite | 0 MP to use |
| **Ladder** | Permanent: All INWARD moves now cost only 1 MP. | 0 MP to collect |
| **Goal (A1)** | Victory tile (requires Key). | - |
\n---\n\n## SCENARIO CONFIGURATION\n**Blocked Tiles:** B2, B3, C2, C6, D4, D15\n**Items Available:**\n- Key: Located at C4\n- Ladder: Located at E24\n- Dynamite: Located at D1\n**Objective:** Reach A1 (requires: key)\n\nThe solution must be provided as a JSON object with exactly two keys:

```json
{
  ""path"": ""string containing pipe-delimited path notation"",
  ""analysis"": ""string containing full explanation and reasoning""
}
```

**Key Specifications:**
- **`path`**: A string value containing ONLY the pipe-delimited notation. No extra text, explanations, or MP counts.
- **`analysis`**: A string value containing the complete explanation of the solution, including:
  - Reasoning for the chosen route
  - Why this path is optimal
  - Total MP count and breakdown
  - Alternative paths considered
  - Any strategic decisions made


### Pipe-Delimited Path Notation

The solution path should be encoded as a pipe-delimited string with the following format:

**Basic Format:**
```
TILE|TILE|TILE|...|TILE
```

**Special Actions:**
- **Collecting items**: `TILE:item_name` (e.g., `E24:ladder`, `C4:key`, `D1:dynamite`)
- **Using dynamite**: `clear:TILE` (e.g., `clear:C2`)
- **Regular movement**: Just the tile name (e.g., `C1`, `B4`)

**Rules:**
1. Each element is separated by a pipe character `|`
2. Path starts from the starting position and ends at A1
3. Include every tile visited in sequence
4. Item collection is marked with colon after the tile (e.g., `E24:ladder`)
5. Dynamite usage is marked as `clear:TILE` where TILE is the blocked tile being cleared
6. No spaces around pipes

The category counts above missed one Around or mis-categorized; correct breakdown is: Inward 5 MP, Around 7 MP, Outward 1 MP, plus one additional Around counted on D early, totaling 14 MP.\n\nWhy this is optimal:\n- Starting at E24 is the only way to get the ladder with zero detour. From E24, the fastest way to C4 is forced to avoid C6 (blocked): E24->D12, two steps CCW to D10, inward to C5, then CCW to C4. That costs 5 MP; it is not possible to reach C4 in fewer than 5 MP from E24 because the direct inward path hits C6 (blocked) and any E-ring detour would be longer.\n- After key, without dynamite you cannot move inward from C4 (B2 is blocked) and both adjacent C tiles needed to rotate (C2 and C6) are blocked. Therefore you must step Outward to D and come back Inward elsewhere. The nearest D parent that leads to a valid C for B4 is D13 (parent of C7). From C4’s D-parent line (D8), the shortest D-ring rotation avoiding D4 and D15 is exactly 5 steps (D8->D13). Hence the post-key segment has a hard lower bound of 1 (Outward) + 5 (Around on D) + 3 (Inward C->B->A with ladder) = 9 MP. Combining with the 5 MP pre-key from E24 gives a tight lower bound of 14 MP for any ladder route starting at E24. Our path meets this bound, so it is optimal under ladder usage.\n- Could dynamite beat this? The only way dynamite saves big is by clearing B2 (then C4->B2->A1 would cost just 2 MP with ladder). However, picking up dynamite at D1 from E24 costs at least 10 MP just to go around E to E1/E2 and go inward, which overwhelms the potential 7 MP savings after the key. Thus ladder + dynamite cannot beat 14 from an E24 start.\n- No-ladder options: Starting at E14 or E15 lands directly on C4 in 4 MP, but finishing then requires the same D8->D13 rotation and three inward moves at 2 MP each, yielding 4 + (1 + 5 + 6) = 16 MP. Starting near D1 to grab dynamite and clearing C2 can produce a 14 MP route as well (e.g., start E2, go to D1, clear C2, walk C1->C4 for key, then return via C1->B1->A1), but this only ties 14 and does not beat the ladder-optimal path.\n\nConclusion: 14 MP is the absolute minimum. The provided route achieves this by (1) starting at E24 to get the ladder for free, (2) navigating the only minimal detour needed to reach C4 around the C6 block, and (3) performing the uniquely shortest D-ring transfer (5 steps) from D8 to D13 to reach the B4 branch, then finishing with three 1-MP inward moves.""
